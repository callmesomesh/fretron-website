Comprehending which trucks are available for loading at any moment can greatly speed up operations.</p><h3>Process Conformity</h3><p> </p><p>Plant automation provides the application of consistent procedures across all yard operations. This uniformity decreases disparities and errors, enabling a more reliable and efficient yard management process.</p><p> </p><p>Suppose a logistics company operates in multiple locations. With plant automation, the business can ensure all their operations, regardless of state or city, follow the same procedures and guidelines. This uniformity results in fewer disparities and mistakes, leading to a more efficient yard management process.</p><h3>Continual Process Improvement</h3><p> </p><p>By harnessing data analytics capabilities, a YMS integrated with plant automation allows for robust KPI setting and measurement. This enables managers to quickly detect and rectify areas of the supply chain that aren&#x27;t meeting performance expectations.</p><p> </p><p>Imagine a courier service handling numerous deliveries that happen each day. Employing a YMS integrated with plant automation, executives can set performance metrics (like delivery times) and measure them in real-time. If any route or process invariably underperforms, they can take quick action to improve it.</p><h3>Carrier Performance Analysis</h3><p> </p><p>A YMS integrated with plant automation provides the tools to track and analyze carrier performance. This enables market players to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer service and optimize resource allocation.</p><p> </p><p>Let&#x27;s take an example of an e-commerce platform relying on various carriers to deliver packages. The YMS, integrated with plant automation, authorizes them to track each carrier&#x27;s performance and study their punctuality, efficiency, and reliability.
