Specifically, the company required a GPS-tracking system to monitor its operations in real-time and guarantee the safe and secure delivery of valuable goods.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/dhl-supply-chain/documents/pdf/dhl-glo-sci-redesigning-global-supply-chain-operations-en.pdf"> rising costs</a> of logistics operations and mounting performance issues have made it necessary for businesses to streamline their logistics operations.</p><p>In this article, we discuss the advantages of streamlining logistics operations and provide businesses with solutions to help them streamline their logistics operations.</p><h2>The Current State of Logistics Operations</h2><p>Logistics operations have come a long way from the manual paper-based processes of yesteryears. Today, most logistics operations are handled using Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, follow-ups, Excel sheets, and integrations with other software.</p><p>However, even with these advancements, logistics teams still face significant challenges. Some common problems logistics teams face include follow-ups, error-prone Excel sheets, and tedious/redundant tasks of reporting and communication.</p><p>Various<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/salesforce/2014/09/13/sorry-spreadsheet-errors/"> studies</a> report that nearly 9 out of 10 spreadsheets (88%) contain errors. This can lead to incorrect data and missed opportunities. Furthermore, logistics teams also face issues in compliance, adherence to dispatch plans, freight theft, accidents, late deliveries, and unsatisfied customers.</p><p>In a staggering revelation, around<a href="https://www.itln.in/logistics/83-logistics-firms-missed-at-least-one-critical-compliance-91-paid-fines-in-last-12-months-report-1347986"> 91%</a> of surveyed logistics and supply chain companies agreed that they had paid fines and penalties in the last 12-month period.</p><p>Companies that prioritize transparency and automation have seen a reduction of up to 75% in follow-up tasks and up to 90% in issues such as theft. These statistics demonstrate the urgency for logistics teams to embrace modern solutions and address the current state of logistics operations.</p><h2>Common Challenges in Streamlining Logistics Operations</h2><p>While streamlining logistics operations is crucial for businesses, it comes with its own set of challenges. In this section we will take a look at three major challenges faced by the logistics teams and ways to overcome them.</p><h3>Sourcing reliable and accountable transporters</h3><h3>During the pandemic, the supply of truck drivers plummeted as drivers were unable or unwilling to work. This has led to a shortage of truck drivers, affecting the ability of logistics teams to ensure timely and transportation efficiency.</h3><h3>To overcome this challenge, logistics teams need to identify and partner with reliable and accountable transporters. Additionally, they need to optimize their logistics operations across the plant, sourcing, warehouse teams, and transporters for pace and warehouse efficiency.</h3><h3>Efficiently Allocating and Dispatching Orders</h3><p>A major challenge is<a href="https://fretron.com/home/logistics-tech-platform/analytics-operations-control-tower/order-dispatch-management-dashboard/"> ensuring smooth order allocation, higher vehicle placements, and faster dispatches,</a> without the hassle of emails and calls and integrating into ERP.</p><p>This requires reducing vehicle allotment time, maintaining a high indent-to-placement ratio, ensuring transparent communication among all stakeholders without follow-ups, multi-channel engagement for all stakeholders, real-time and effective ETA tracking, and proactive issue resolution.</p><p>To address these challenges, logistics teams need to ensure complete compliance with proactive issue resolution. A proactive approach to supply chain risk management can help mitigate threats, ensure business continuity, and prevent the organization from being blindsided by unforeseen crisis events.</p><h3>Ensuring Transparent Communication among stakeholders</h3><p>Logistics teams also face issues with gaps in reporting and delayed communication, resulting in delays from Excel-based Management Information Systems (MIS).</p><p>While Microsoft Excel is still the application of choice for transportation in supply chain management at many companies, it may not be the best option for logistics and supply chain optimization planning.</p><p>Using Excel for logistics management can lead to errors in forecasting, purchasing management, and logistics functions. This can result in slow and inaccurate billing, affecting the overall efficiency of the logistics operations.</p><p>Addressing these challenges requires implementing modern logistics management systems that streamline communication and automate processes to reduce errors and ensure timely delivery.</p><h2>Roadmap to Streamlining and Optimizing Logistics Operations</h2><h3>Streamlining end-to-end team operations with SLAs</h3><p>Streamlining end-to-end team operations is crucial for efficient logistics management. This involves defining macro and micro tasks in the workflow, centralizing all teams on one platform, and assigning service level agreements (SLAs) to each team member for each task.</p><p>Assigning SLAs ensures that each team member is held accountable for their assigned tasks and helps achieve set goals. Checklists are also distributed to increase the efficiency of operations and ensure all tasks are completed.</p><p>Centralizing all teams on one platform enables better communication and coordination between teams, leading to a more streamlined and optimized logistics operation.</p><h3>Onboarding all transporters onto a centralized transporter portal</h3><p>By centralizing all transporter-related information onto a single platform, businesses can easily track and manage their transportation partners. This includes their SLAs and contract details, such as pricing, payment terms, and service level expectations.</p><p>With all this information in one place, businesses can quickly identify any issues or discrepancies and proactively address them to avoid any disruptions in the supply chain.</p><p>Furthermore, a centralized Transporter Portal enables businesses to streamline communication and collaboration with their transporters, leading to greater transparency and efficiency in logistics operations.</p><h3>Streamlining shipment tracking</h3><p>To streamline shipment tracking, you must have multiple options available for tracking. This includes SIM-based, GPS-based, smartphone-based, and Fastag-based tracking.</p><p>Each method has its own benefits and can help provide greater visibility into shipment movements.</p><p>SIM-based tracking can provide reliable tracking in areas where GPS signals are weak, while GPS-based tracking provides accurate location information.</p><p>Smartphone-based tracking allows real-time updates on shipment location and status, and Fastag-based tracking enables automated toll payment and tracking.</p><p>By using a combination of these tracking methods, businesses can ensure they have the most comprehensive view of their shipments and can proactively address any issues that may arise.</p><h3>Communicating with stakeholders in real-time</h3><p>Transparent real-time communication is critical for effective logistics operations management. Businesses can achieve this by onboarding all customers to a customer portal and accessing real-time shipment tracking information.</p><p>Additionally, providing shareable live shipment location links for customers, sales, and plant/warehouse teams can help keep everyone informed and updated.</p><p>Sending regular updates on shipment milestones through Whatsapp, text, or email can also improve communication and increase transparency. By implementing these measures, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and ensure smooth logistics operations.</p><h3>Simplifying load planning</h3><p>Simplifying<a href="https://fretron.com/home/logistics-tech-platform/complete-logistics-orchestration/ai-driven-intelligent-load-builder/"> load planning</a> is a crucial step in streamlining logistics operations. Businesses can achieve this by centralizing all SKUs/material types and Carrier vehicle types on a single platform.</p><p>Pro Tip: Use a 3D load visualizer tool to create effective loading plans across different SKUs/Materials to save time and effort.</p><p>Furthermore, ensuring efficient loading need proper communication of load plans to plant/warehouse loading teams as part of their SLAs.
