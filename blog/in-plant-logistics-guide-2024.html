But what happens after raw materials arrive and before finished goods exit your factory doors? That&#x27;s where in-plant logistics comes in. This often-overlooked aspect of supply chain logistics plays a critical role in ensuring a smooth flow of materials, components, and finished products throughout your facility.</p><p>This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know to optimize your in-plant logistics operations, improve production flow, and boost efficiency. Learn about the challenges of inefficient plant logistics, why efficiency is important, and the best tips on optimizing in-plant logistics management to gain a competitive edge.</p><p>In-plant logistics is not a dark matter anymore! Let&#x27;s begin.</p><h2><strong>What is in-plant logistics?</strong></h2><p>In-plant logistics, also known as internal logistics, refers to the intricate and systematic management of materials, goods, and shipment movements within a manufacturing facility. This includes the reception, handling, and storage of inbound raw materials, components, and parts as they enter the plant, as well as their transportation to various production lines and workstations. Throughout the production process, work-in-progress items are carefully moved between different stages to ensure seamless workflow and efficiency. Upon completion, finished goods are then transported to designated storage areas before being prepared for outbound shipment.</p><p>The meticulous coordination of these internal movements is crucial for maintaining production schedules, minimizing delays, and ensuring that shipments are correctly balanced, secured, and compliant with all regulations. Effective in-plant logistics ensures that every movement within the plant is optimized for efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness, contributing significantly to the overall success of the supply chain.</p><h2><strong>Key In-Plant Logistics Processes to Know About</strong></h2><p>Let&#x27;s capture the entire flow of logistical processes within a plant, highlighting the critical steps involved in managing the movement of goods efficiently and securely.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong> Gate Entry and Vehicle Registration:</strong> Upon arrival, the vehicle undergoes a security check to ensure it meets safety and compliance standards. Vehicle details, driver information, and shipment documentation are recorded in the system.</li><li><strong> Weighbridge Check-In:</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Inbound:</strong> The vehicle is directed to the weighbridge for an initial weighing to record the gross weight, ensuring accurate weight tracking for inventory and compliance purposes. The recorded weight is documented and linked to the vehicle and shipment details.</p><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> The empty vehicle is directed to the weighbridge for an initial weighing to record the tare weight. The recorded weight is documented and linked to the vehicle and shipment details.</p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong> Dock Assignment:</strong> Based on the type of materials and the availability of docks, the vehicle is assigned a specific dock.</li></ol><p><strong>Inbound:</strong> This step includes scheduling and coordinating the arrival of vehicles to minimize wait times and congestion.</p><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> The assignment is based on the shipment schedule and dock availability, coordinating the departure of vehicles to minimize wait times and congestion.</p><ol start="4" role="list"><li><strong> Loading/Unloading:</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Inbound:</strong> Equipment such as forklifts or conveyor belts are prepared for unloading materials from the vehicle. Materials are checked against the purchase order and shipment documentation to ensure accuracy in quantity and quality.</p><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> Forklifts, pallet jacks, or conveyor belts are used to load the vehicle. The load is verified against the shipment order to ensure accuracy and completeness. During loading, the placement of the shipment within the vehicle or container is carefully planned to ensure it is properly balanced and there is no risk of damage during transportation.</p><ol start="5" role="list"><li><strong> Quality Inspection:</strong> A quality control team inspects the materials for any damage or discrepancies.</li></ol><p><strong>Inbound:</strong> Samples may be taken for further testing. Inspection results are documented, and any issues are reported immediately.</p><ol start="6" role="list"><li><strong> Weighbridge Check-Out:</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Inbound:</strong> After unloading, the vehicle returns to the weighbridge for a final weighing to record the tare weight (vehicle weight without the load). This ensures the weight of the unloaded materials is accurately recorded. The net weight of the received materials is calculated by subtracting the tare weight from the initial gross weight. The recorded weight is documented and linked to the vehicle and shipment details.</p><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> After loading, the vehicle returns to the weighbridge for a final weighing to record the gross weight. The net weight of the loaded materials is calculated by subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight. This step ensures accuracy in shipment weight for billing and regulatory compliance. The recorded weight is documented and linked to the vehicle and shipment details.</p><ol start="7" role="list"><li><strong> Material Handling and Storage:</strong> Materials are tagged and labeled for easy identification and traceability. They are then transported to designated storage areas using material handling equipment and organized systematically in the warehouse for efficient retrieval. The allocation of yard space for different types of goods is determined based on demand, storage requirements, and turnaround time.</li><li><strong> Inventory Management:</strong> The inventory management system is updated with the newly received materials. Inventory levels are monitored to ensure optimal stock levels are maintained. A<a href="https://fretron.com/yard-management-system-increase-logistics-efficiency/"> yard management system</a> enables real-time tracking of inventory, vehicles, and personnel, facilitating communication between different departments and stakeholders.</li><li><strong> Order Processing and Picking:</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> Customer orders are confirmed, and picking lists are generated. Materials or finished goods are picked from the storage areas based on the picking lists.</p><ol start="10" role="list"><li><strong> Preparation for Loading:</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> Items are packaged securely to prevent damage during transit. Packages are labeled with relevant information, including destination, handling instructions, and barcodes for tracking.</p><ol start="11" role="list"><li><strong> Documentation and Compliance:</strong> Required shipping documents, such as the bill of lading, packing list, and export/import documents (if applicable), are prepared and handed to the driver. Compliance with all relevant regulations and safety standards, including those related to hazardous materials, security, and environmental protection, is ensured.</li><li><strong> Final Inspection and Sealing:</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Outbound:</strong> A final inspection ensures the load is secure and complies with safety standards. The vehicle is sealed with tamper-proof seals to ensure the shipment&#x27;s integrity during transit.</p><ol start="13" role="list"><li><strong> Exit and Departure:</strong> The vehicle is cleared by security and allowed to exit the plant. Yard operations are monitored and managed to ensure that goods and vehicles move smoothly through the facility, promptly addressing any issues or delays.</li></ol><p>By integrating these comprehensive and coordinated processes for inbound and outbound shipments, manufacturing plants can optimize their in-plant logistics, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving overall supply chain performance.</p><h2><strong>Key challenges of poor in-plant logistics management</strong></h2><p>India’s logistics cost per GDP is 13%, the blame for which is mostly borne by the poor road infrastructure or the unique geographical challenges of the country. However, the pandemic revealed deeper problems in the overall logistics setup where transportation on the road was not the sole culprit. <a href="https://fretron.com/challenges-of-manual-in-plant-logistics/">Operational bottlenecks inside warehouses or manufacturing plants</a> greatly impacted overall supply chain logistics performance</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Delays and congestion:</strong> Poor management and truck scheduling result in delays at multiple points, from gate entry and vehicle registration to loading and unloading docks. This leads to congestion and longer vehicle turnaround times. A lack of synchronization in yard processes causes bottlenecks, misallocation of resources, and excessive wait times, especially during peak periods.</li><li><strong>Inventory management issues:</strong> Inaccurate weighbridge records and poor handling and storage practices lead to incorrect inventory counts, resulting in overstocking or stockouts. Inefficient yard management exacerbates these issues by failing to allocate yard space optimally and manage vehicle movements effectively. This impacts production continuity and increases carrying costs.</li><li><strong>Quality control compromises:</strong> Delays in the quality inspection process can slow down logistics flow or allow substandard materials into production, affecting product quality. Manual processes prone to errors and lack of real-time tracking hinder effective quality control, leading to increased rework and returns.</li><li><strong>Increased costs:</strong> Inefficiencies in material handling, storage, and shipment preparation lead to higher labour costs, increased use of material handling equipment, and potential fines for regulatory non-compliance. Extensive demurrage or detention charges due to delays at the shipper’s site further inflate costs. Improving management processes can minimize these charges and provide substantial financial benefits.</li><li><strong>Safety and compliance risks:</strong> Inefficient processes create safety hazards, such as improper handling of hazardous materials or unsecured loads. Lack of real-time visibility and manual record-keeping result in compromising compliance with regulatory standards. This can lead to legal and financial repercussions.</li><li><strong>Poor customer satisfaction:</strong> Delays and errors in order processing and shipment preparation lead to late deliveries and incorrect orders, negatively impacting customer satisfaction. Human dependency on overall coordination and the inability to view real-time activities exacerbate these issues, damaging the company’s reputation.</li><li><strong>Lack of real-time visibility:</strong> The inability to view the actual location of vehicles within the plant stages hampers proactive management of operations.
